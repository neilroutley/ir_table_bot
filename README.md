This is an Arduino sketch for a SMARS Robot to detect the edge of a table using an IR sensor and turn around, driving back to the starting edge of the table.

Work in progress.

Robot does have ultrasonic which will be use for another table challenge.

Robot might also be made to do line following with the same IR sensor.
